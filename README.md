# Shortest-Path

An interactive HTML5 canvas graph where the edge weights are the euclidean pix![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99485539/183243100-60097836-0ccb-4e5c-b92d-93127efd17aa.jpg)
el distance between any one edge's incident nodes. Upon selecting a source node and a terminal node, you can see the shortest path (if a path does exist) between them by pressing Begin. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to compute the shortest path. To see the shortest path between any other two nodes, press Reset. For a whole new graph, press New Graph.

./source/canvas_version contains the latest version utilizing only the HTML5 canvas object and no other third-party libraries.
