# Shortest-Path

An interactive HTML5 canvas graph where the edge weights are the euclidean pixel distance between any one edge's incident nodes. Upon selecting a source node and a terminal node, you can see the shortest path (if a path does exist) between them by pressing Begin. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to compute the shortest path. To see the shortest path between any other two nodes, press Reset. For a whole new graph, press New Graph.
